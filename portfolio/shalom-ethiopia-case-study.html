            <h1>Case Study: Shalom Ethiopia Tours</h1>
            <div class="subheader">Website design and development for an Ethiopian Tour Operator<br />June 2018 - Present</div>
            <h2>Preface</h2>
            <main class="side-border">In June 2018, my mother and aunt treated me to a special three week trip in Ethiopia as a gift for graduating college. Needless to say, the trip was surreal and humbling. Our private guide, Andy, and his driver took us all across the country and organized many intimate encounters with the native people. Andy and I bonded, and in the last week of the trip I asked him about his work. "So tell me... How do you source clients? Do you have a website or any digital presence?"<br><br>
                At the time, he was working in conjunction with other agencies and sharing the profits while getting referrals mostly from past clients. He shared with me his dream to open up his own business one day and call it Shalom Ethiopia Tours, hoping to provide a better life for himself and his family. "How long would it take you to set everything up?" He spoke of two years, perhaps more. By the end of our trip, the country and its people left such a strong impression on me that I couldn't leave without giving something back. I decided to help him. "Let's stay in touch. I will build your digital presence". </main>

                <h2>Research Phase</h2>
                The research was comprehensive and began the moment I decided I would help Andy. This phase can be segmented across the following topics:
                <h3>Business Objectives vs User Objectives</h3>
                <p>
                    In the final week of the trip I sat with Andy and discussed his business at length. How he would run it, what types of trips would he be organizing, how would he handle payments, interact with prospective customers etc. Most importantly, we discussed how building his digital presence would fit into the business pipeline and convert prospective leads into customers. After understanding his objectives as a business, we shifted perspectives and looked at things from the customer's point of view. What were the characteristics of a typical customer? What information do they typically need before making a final decision on whether to go on a trip? How can this website answer the most common questions while getting them excited to go with Andy's services over other options? All this was taken into account
                </p>
                <h3>Client Constraints</h3>
                <p>
                    These constraints revolved around interacting with the clients - most particularly financial transactions. Although Ethiopia's economy is progressing, there are still many financial barriers that make it hard for small businesses to stay afloat. Taxes are incredibly high for business owners, and money is allowed to only be wired into the country from outside while it can't be wired out. Setting up a PayPal or Stripe account is not possible, as these services are not compatible with Ethiopian bank accounts. Additionally, Andy's budget for handling a website was low so it wouldn't make sense to sign up for a monthly subscription to WordPress or Wix. More on this in the development stage.
                </p>
                <h3>Target Audience</h3>
                <p>
                    After discussing the user objectives with Andy, I had a better idea of what customers are typically looking to go on trips in rural Africa. It was time to ask about the journey leading up to making the decision to go on such a trip, and what better people to interview than my mother and aunt? Talking to them about their communication with Andy, what was important for them to understand and resolve before sealing the trip, and any frustrations they had with the process was valuable information.
                </p>
                <h3>Market Research</h3>
                <p>
                    Market research involved looking at the websites of other competitors that offer the same services as Andy. Aside from looking at how their websites were designed and following through their informational architecture, I looked at how they presented their services. As a casual visitor to their site, was it clear what their business was about? Was I able to properly distinguish between the different types of trips they were offering and potentially make a choice? I scrolled through a handful of the top Ethiopian Tour Operators with very critical eyes and made sure to take note of what they did well and not so well.
                </p>
                <h3>Informational Research</h3>
                <p>
                    This step in the research phase was less about the website and more about Ethiopia as a country. I researched and summarized the highlights of Ethiopia as would a travel book, while accompanying the information with strong visuals and imagery. A full page of the website was dedicated to educating a potential customer on what they could expect from a tour in Ethiopia, with a background on the country's culture, key destinations, and information about the cuisine among other topics.

                <h2>Design Phase</h2>
                <h3>Informational Architecture & User Flow</h3>
                <p>
                    The design phase began with mapping out the informational architecture of the website. Grouping the information into separate segments was done using the Pattern method discussed in this article, resulting in four main focus areas which later received their own respective web pages:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Landing page </li>
                        <li>Detailed breakdown of the services offered</li>
                        <li>Information about the country</li>
                        <li>Photo gallery</li>
                        <li>Booking request form</li>
                    </ul>
                    Each page plays a unique role in informing and persuading the customer into using the business' services.
                </p>
                <div class="standalone-image-container">
                    <div class="standalone-image-header">Preliminary Informational Architecture</div>
                <img class="standalone-image" src="../images/shalomethiopia/informational-architecture.png" alt="Informational Architecture">
                </div>
                    <h3>Wireframing & User Interface Design</h3>
                    <p>
                        Once the mapping and user flow of the website was complete, I went ahead and constructed the layout of each page. Using the same Pattern method mentioned above, I grouped related pieces of information into different segments and sketched up rough wireframes on paper. Each page had two rough wireframe sketches - one for mobile screens and another for desktop screens. The next step involved translating these rough sketches into colorful, well designed, stylized mockups with Sketch.
                    </p>

                                    <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
                                    Every aspect of the website's design was intentional. Below are some highlights of the design decisions I made:
                                    <ul id="design-decisions">
                                        <li>
                                            <h4>Color scheme</h4>
                                            <p>The colors seen on the website were quite literally sampled (with an eyedropper tool) from photographs I took while traveling to Ethiopia. The palette is interwoven into every page of the website, including the business logo. Additionally, I made sure fonts had colors that had an appropriate contrast ratio to their background to ensure accessibility.</p>
                                        </li>
                                        <li><h4>Page Ribbons</h4>
                                            <p> Instead of dividing different sections of the page only with color (or could have been only with headers), I decided to use traditional African patterns to add a nice touch.</p>
                                        </li>
                                        <li><h4>Request Booking Button</h4>
                                            <p>The website's ultimate purpose is to get customers to book a tour. I made sure the button was distinguished with a yellow border and could be found on the navigation bar of each page (including the header of the homepage).</p>
                                        </li>
                                        <li><h4>Responsive, Mobile-First Design</h4>
                                            <p>An increasing amount of people browse the internet through their phones. My aunt (who went on this trip with me) in fact ONLY uses her phone. I made sure the website caters to this group of people and function smoothly on mobile screens (tablet screens included).</p>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
